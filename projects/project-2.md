For a class at Leeward Community College, our final project was to use the information we learned from class to create a plausible operating system. My team was made of myself and two other people. Later it bcame myself and one other person. This project was particularly challenging because I have never looked into what is needed to create a operating system, so there was a lot of research that went into creating it.

The work was divided equally between the three of us. Each person taking on multiple sections of an operating system to make the work load easier and managable. About half way through the project, one of our members dropped the class and we were left with a week to research his part. Looking back I appreaciate this because this taught me how you can't predict everything and you have to rely on others when these events happen. In the end my other partner and I split the remaining work and worked a little extra to complete it.
