summary: A website that was developed by my team and I for our ICS class.
---

Our team was consisted of two digital media majors and an ICS major. Digital media students were tasked with the overall design of the website, while the ICS students were tasked with the back end of the project. 

This website included each instructor in the ICS department at Leeward Community College. It listed what classes and section that each instructor taught. It also listed their office locations and contact information. It used a combination of different types of inputs that were cross referenced a database to produce the information that was requested.
