Using eslint with intellij for the past week feels like the first week at a new job.
I'm excited to start something new, but scared at the same time. Like when you start a new
job, you usually have an idea of what you'll be doing, but not the big picture. I know how IDEs
work and they all have basically the same layout and execute the same way. What I found most
interesting was the short-cuts. I'm still memorizing them, but from what I saw, I can see
how beneficial they can be. This is the biggest difference between intellij and other IDEs I have
used. Slowly but surely I will memorize them all and be able to code without taking my hands off the keyboard.
As for the green checkmark it's not painful to get. There are some coding styles that I have to get use to, but
it's not that hard. I find it quite useful because it forces to me to make my code more uniform.
In a way it's like that manager who gets on your case because the quality of your work is not up to standards.
