The way you format your question and the reasoning for your question are factors on determining if your question is a smart one.
I'm not saying that some people are stupid because of the questions they ask, but rather they could benefit more if they thought about what
they were trying to say and to ask the question when there was no answer that they could find. I looked into what smart and not so smart question could be 
like. I used the site Stack Overflow in search of these questions.

The first question that I found in my mind is a smart question, the question was "Why is it faster to process a sorted array than an unsorted array". 
This strikes me as a smart way to ask a question because it shows that the
developer is interested in how something works. The developer provides a piece of code
and wonders why is it that the code gets the results it does. Showing other developers that you have
an interest in a topic, makes it feel like what they are telling you is worth their time rather than answer a question
just so you can finish your homework before the due date.

My second question that I found searching through Stack Overflow "Java String.equals versus ==". The question format isn't the best,
but the reason I chose this was because of the subject the question is
referring to. The difference between .equal() and == operand is actually
an easy topic that can be found in the documentation. I also have
the belief that the developer who asked the question, didn't look for the answer 
before asking because his post was marked as a duplicate. If the developer had
taken the time to look through the documentation or to go to a search engine and
ask his question, he probably could've gotten his answer faster.

After reading the reactions between the two question I have come to the conclusion that both questions get answers,
but how the public reacts to the question is different. The better question gets answers that people are happy to give, where
the questions that aren't well thought out get answers, but the people answering them seem to express it differently. I've personally turned to the internet
in search for answer to my programming question and I've seen forums where questions that everyone knew was for a homework assignment, would have answers like "Do
your own homework" or "Try solving it yourself first". So asking smart question is very important as a software engineer because there will be times you don't 
know the answer, but it's out there somewhere. Someone else probably had the same question you had, you just have to find it and if you can't the community is always
willing to help.
