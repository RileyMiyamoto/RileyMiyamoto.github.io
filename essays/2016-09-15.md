If only I could manage my job as easily as I can manage configurations. I can see that configuration management is important and I can see why github is popular. It's interesting how a group of people can come together and work on a single project in one area without people there together. It's also interesting how you are able to pull repos from other people and make changes for them and give it back. It's a very efficient way of error checking. In most of my programming classes whenever we had an issue or needed help with something, we would always have to be there with each other or email codes to correct them. This however is a very inefficient way, especially when you have a large group of people who make changes and no way to check what was changed unless you read through each persons code. If I had this ability when it came to work, then I wouldn't have to call it work anymore.

I think github is popular because of git because I feel that github was created as an extension of git. I think that git's ability to configure manage is what started it all and with the addition of github it made it accessible from anywhere. If there was no git then there couldn't have been a github.
