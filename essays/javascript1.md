It's the end of the first two weeks of being introduced to javascript and I feel that after more time using this programming language I'll
start to like it. I've seen javascript before, but this was about 13 years ago when MySpace was big and every kid thought they were cool
cause they could edit their profiles and make it look cool. Comparing Javascript to other languages that I have seen in the past, I've 
learned that there are differences, but there are also similarities. While doing some exercises with javascript it felt like I was coding
in Java, C, and C++ again. It had all the same feelings of accomplishment when you get the results you were looking for and the infuriation 
when you didn't. Since I didn't have a lot of experience with javascript most of the material was new to me, but becuase I do have a background 
with other languages, it wasn't that foreign to me. I am hoping that there will be elements that I haven't seen before, becuase I'm sure it will 
be a challenge to solve and I do like challenges. Personally I think javascript is a good programming language from a software engineering perspective.

Athletic software engineering is an interesting idea. I will say that I've never been taught to program with this style. Although it may be hard I feel 
it will benefit me more because it's making my ability to recall solutions faster. The practice WODs are useful to an extent. It's a great 
way to practice the same situation that'll experience when actually doing them in class, but it's like a practice match versus a real match.
A practice match tries to duplicate the real match, but when you actually doing it, it has a completely different feel. I do think that after a
couple times I'll get better and it will show positive results in the end.
